## About ezComeUp
In our contemporary, it is almost impossible to normally buy from online stores such as Supreme or SNKRS app. Due to low supply from the retailers, this creates both quantative value and FOMA (Fear Of Missing Out). To fans, this means each drop is a chance to participate in the latest trends or maybe add to their collection. To resellers, this is a chance to capitalize on the hype, and make some money.

Since people are aware of this information, unfortuantely, this makes purchasing from said stores into a BIG competition. You are not only competing against other buyers, but you are competing with computers that can make tens-to-thousands of purchases a second. Eventually it became ESSENTIAL to own a bot just to purchase anything from these stores. So we realized, if you can't beat em, join em.

Introducing ezComeUp, a program that automates your purchases from these stores and assures you that *YOU WILL* secure a purchase from adding to cart, to checking out, to delivery. 

### How it works
1. Purchase a key from our website.
2. Download ezComeUp on our website.
3. Start up program and provide the key and email the key is associated with.
4. Provide required information.
5. Check what items stores are about to drop.
6. Add items to dashboard and get bot ready to purchase before time of drop.
7. Wait for delivery of item.
8. Enjoy your product.

### What Information We Store
1. Email
2. Key Email is associated with
3. Where the Login is coming from

We **DO NOT** store your Delivery Address, Billing Address, Payment Details or Store Account info onto our own servers as we respect and support your privacy. The information you provide to the program is all stored localy (within your own computer) and is encrypted incase hackers or an unauthorized user were to access your computer. Once ezComeUp is uninstalled the information is permanently deleted. Upon reinstallation, you will have to provide the information again.

### !!! IMPORTANT !!!
Although botting is not federally illegal (at least in the U.S.), it 9/10 times goes against the store's terms and service agreements. We do not condone you use this bot unless you are willing (at worst) to get permanently banned from said stores.
